# voyager-decoder
An experiment in decoding the audio-encoded Voyager probe images. These images are encoded in a stereo sound clip, around 8 minutes long, with each image taking about 5 seconds of data.

This was coded over the course of a few days, in Java.

Some extra libraries are needed, these are provided in the Maven pom.xml file:
 - com.googlecode.soundlibs/tritonus-share - extra audio features
 - com.googlecode.soundlibs/mp3spi - for MP3 decoding
 - com.googlecode.soundlibs/vorbisspi - for OGG decoding
 - org.apache.commons/commons-math3 - for statistical processing
 - com.beust/jcommander - command-line options
 
This project does not decode the images 100% correctly, it also does not handle color or any metadata that might be available.
There are numerous other limitations as well.

**An important note: the software works best with *normalized* 96Khz 16-bit .WAV files.**

Currently (18 Oct 2017), 156 images are generated by the program, with various degrees of legibility.

The code is not in a "production" state, but it could provide an easy framework to start with for someone looking to do something similar.
A lot of the tedious work is already done:
 - decoding sound files in various formats
 - decoding interleaved sound data to retrieve usable sample values
 - buffering, multi-threading, multi-channel processing
 - sound (audio output) rendering
 - waveform visualisation
 - scaled image generation with basic image controls and saving to PNG
